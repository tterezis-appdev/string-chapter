# Using the chapter section and code example you 
# just read on ASCII codes, add to the code below,
# and run it from the terminal window by typing:
#     
#     ruby concat.rb
#
# after the $-sign prompt and pressing enter.
#
# This script should output:
# 
#   "Ruby's fun"
#
# using ASCII codes and concat.
# Start by creating a new (empty) String class variable:

s = 


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# concat.rb should output 'Ruby's fun' using concat
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
